# Beat Saber NoPause

## This replaces Long Press Duration in the base game

Do you use Long Pause Duration? Do you *still* have trouble with accidentally pausing occasionally? So do I, and I hate it! So, NoPause has come into existence. I hope you get as much use out of this as I do.

This plugin hooks the menu button listener's Tick() method and prevents it from being called, thus preventing the user from pausing.
Additionally, the user can hold both triggers and press a menu button to pause.
